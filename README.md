# Creating-Charts-and-Dashboards-using-Tableau
In this guided project, you create interactive dashboards and charts using Tableau Online. You’ll start by creating maps, then you’ll create column, circle, dual, and bubble charts. Finally, you’ll bring all of these charts together into a single dashboard, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the given data.
